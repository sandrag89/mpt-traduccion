ENCOURAGE RECYCLING: 
MPT aims to revolutionize the metal packaging industry, by making it more cost-effective, eliminating or reducing the economic advantages of other less recyclable packaging materials.: 
COMPETITIVE CHARGING: 
Brand owners will be able to determine unilaterally to which degree they incentivize their own recycling. Blockchain technology will give brand owners direct access to their recycling rates. :
ELIMINATE COMMISSIONS: 
MPT will set the standard that commissions (fees), through the whole chain, are paid out in MPT. This standard will make the cost-effectiveness of the chain more transparent.: 
METAL SCRAP PURCHASE PROGRAM: 
MPT will reserve a total of 10% of the maximum token supply, in order to massively purchase metal scrap and sending it directly to melt. This will create healthier global market conditions as well as increase material quality.:
